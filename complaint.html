<h1> How to Complain </h1>
<ol> 
	<li>Talk to your teacher. Teachers can be surprisingly reasonable. If you do not have a good oppurtunity or do not feel confortable talking to your teacher, skip to step 2 </li>
	<li>Send your teacher an email. In addition to providing both of you more time to provide a thoughtful response, it documents your complaint in writing in case you need to escalate.
	<li>Contact you guidence counselor. You can send an email, or make an appointment at student services before or after school. Your guidence counselor should be able to advise you further</li>
	<li>Contact the principal or assistant principal. Initial contact should take place by email. You may recive a reply to your email, or the administrator may request to meet in person</li>
	<li>File a <a href=http://www.hcpss.org/f/files/formal-concern-form.pdf>parent concern form</a></li>
	<li>Contact the Community Superintendent</li>
</ol>
You can also contact the Ombudsman, who can direct you individuals in the school system who may be able to help you
